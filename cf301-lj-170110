Today, I'd say that the large lesson was surrounding attentiveness to detail, and assumptions. I made a few easily avoidable errors - errors that could have been avoided with a greater attentiveness to detail. That lack of attentiveness was due to assumptions based on prior experience - but when circumstances change, it's important to change accordingly. Assumptions... well, everyone knows what the deal is with those. I think that this is something highly transferrable to positions in technology (and, really, employment in general). *Pay attention to the details*. Different managers will have different styles - sometimes things will be on the lax side, sometimes things will be on the exacting side. I think that it's *most* important to adapt to the requirements presented, to fit into the mold that you must at that moment (or be like water, as ye olde Bruce Lee might say). Regardless of the culture, however, that may allow a lack of attentiveness, I think it's really a good idea  that I remain constantly attentive to details, because ultimately more attentiveness will yield better results. I also need to remember that no one is perfect, least of all myself, and to not stress the spilt milk. You're more than the moment, more than the screw up, and life is about learning how to relax.
