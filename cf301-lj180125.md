# Learning Journal 25 Jan 18

I'd say that the past week or so has been very valuable. Not only from the perspective of ingraining MVC - or beginning to at any rate - but from the perspective of pushing me and encouraging me to work harder, longer. One thing that I have a great deal of difficulty with is in relaying concepts when I'm not entirely solid on them. Basically trying to direct pair programming when I need to do my own experimentation to find a solution. I think that being forced to try and talk though a problem that I would normally quickly and iteratively type through is something. It's super hard, for starters, when you're not entirely sure on "the right way" to do something, and yet you're trying to describe things that should be done. I think that it encouraged me to think more carefully about things before speaking, and it may well have helped (to some degree) with ingraining the MVC concepts that I think were the highlight of the week. That's a useful paradigm. Knowing what thing consititutes what part of that MVC construct is something that takes a degree of understanding that I'm still working toward, but I think that by the end of the book project I was beginning to get an understanding of that. Also of note - I really have limited patience. I mean, I think in relative terms I'm not too bad, but I constantly try to improve things like patience, because (just in life terms) patience is the kind of thing that ideally would be endless, and yet we all so often come up short. It's good to identify those shortcomings and do my best to try and surmount them. Also I am out of beer, so I think I'll call it here. \o/
